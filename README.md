# Disinfection Calculator

This project is a custom-built disinfection calculator created as a freelance project for a client. The calculator allows users to select various types of disinfections and input the area/volume of the room they intend to treat. Upon selection, it computes and displays the required amount of disinfectant needed for the specified area/volume, simplifying the process of determining the appropriate quantities for different disinfection scenarios.

The website was creted using HTML/CSS/JS. 

The calculator utilizes a technical document provided by the client to ensure accurate calculations based on the chosen disinfection methods and the dimensions of the space requiring treatment. Here is the technical document:
